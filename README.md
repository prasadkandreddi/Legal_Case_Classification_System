# ⚖️ Legal Case Classification System

An end-to-end **Machine Learning & NLP application** that predicts the **type of court case**
based on a given legal case description.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from text preprocessing and model
training to deployment using **Streamlit** and **Hugging Face Spaces**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Legal case descriptions are often lengthy and complex.  
Manually identifying the category of a case can be time-consuming and error-prone.

This project aims to **automatically classify legal cases** into their respective
types using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Text-based legal case type prediction
- NLP preprocessing and feature extraction
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Naive Bayes classification model
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit
- Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Details
- **Problem Type:** Multi-class Classification  
- **Algorithm:** Naive Bayes  
- **Text Vectorization:** TF-IDF  
- **Libraries Used:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, streamlit  

---

## ⚖️ Legal Case Categories Supported

The model can classify a legal case into the following categories:

- **Civil Law**
- **Criminal Law**
- **Constitutional Law**
- **Consumer Law**
- **Family Law**
- **Labour Law**
- **Taxation Law**
- ** Property Law**

> 📌 The prediction depends on the textual content and context provided in the case description.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. User enters a legal case description  
2. Text is cleaned and transformed using TF-IDF  
3. Trained Naive Bayes model predicts the case type  
4. Result is displayed through a Streamlit web interface

## ⚠️ Notes
- Model and transformer are loaded using pickle files
- This project is intended for **learning, portfolio, and demonstration purposes**
- Deployment environment issues were handled using proper Python and library version control
